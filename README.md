## Getting Started

1 First run the backend server from the given repository, that server will be run on `http://localhost:3001`

2 Install the front-end dependencies using command `yarn`

3  First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Points to test

1 you can visit for the /signup, /signin page for initial registration, login

2 `/users` page is for listing the page (only visible after login) from here you can delete, edit user information!



Necessary Points

1) Authentication validation is not done yet!, like `signin` should only display after login!, it's not 100% completed!
